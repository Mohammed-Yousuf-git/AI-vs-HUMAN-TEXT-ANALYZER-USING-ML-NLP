HOW TO DOWNLOAD YOUR PROJECT FILES:

Since I cannot create zip files directly, here are the ways to get all your files:

METHOD 1 - Download from Browser (Recommended):
1. You should see a download button or export option in your current environment
2. Look for "Download Project" or "Export" buttons in the interface
3. This will give you a complete zip file with all the code

METHOD 2 - Copy Files Manually:
All the files have been created in this project. You can:
1. Copy each file's content from the file explorer on the left
2. Create the same folder structure on your local machine
3. Paste the content into corresponding files

METHOD 3 - Git Clone (if available):
If this environment supports git, you can clone the repository to your local machine.

REQUIRED FILES TO COPY:
├── src/App.tsx (Updated React component)
├── backend/main.py (FastAPI server)
├── backend/rewrite.py (T5 text rewriting)
├── backend/requirements.txt (Python dependencies)
├── backend/model/.gitkeep (Placeholder for your models)
├── setup_instructions.md (Setup guide)
└── All existing config files (package.json, etc.)

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to add your model files:
- backend/model/ai_detector_tfidf.pkl
- backend/model/vectorizer.pkl

The setup_instructions.md file contains complete setup steps for running the application locally.
